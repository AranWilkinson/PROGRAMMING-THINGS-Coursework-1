-===============================================================================-
I decided to use G4P and processing to create my UI as I have worked a lot with
java2D before in other projects and have a good understanding of how it works. 
The G4P form creator is easy to use and allows for in depth events to be utilised, 
this enabled me to create a nice user friend GUI in a short time frame. The GUI 
itself is relatively simple but I tried to follow a consistent approach in the 
looks and layout as to not confuse the user.
